### Contributing to dockerfile-best-practices
Any pull request will be welcome. Thanks for contributing to this repository. Before you submit your PR, you should take a look at the following steps. 
Please make sure your pull request is followed the following steps.

1. Make sure this document is not translated in your language yet. If you found your language there, you can keep contributing to that translated directory.
2. Follow the [Codes arranged alphabetically by alpha-3/ISO 639-2 Code](https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php) table to find your language code/ISO 639-1 Code (e.g. `en`) 
and the language-in-English (e.g. `English`).
3. If you are translating to a new language, create a new directory named your language code in the root directory of the project. It includes all static files and 
the main `README.md` file.
4. Don't forget to add your language-in-English link to the main README.
